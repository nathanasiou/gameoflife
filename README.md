## PSEUDO-RANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS IN THE GAME OF LIFE 

Python implementation of John Conwayâ€™s Game of Life and evaluation of the performance of the Mersenne Twister and Permuted Congruential generators in the game, featuring randomized grid dimensions, randomized cell states, the ability to set specific pseudo random number (PRN) generators, and automatic program termination when a pattern starts repeating. 

## Code Description
Python code to simulate The Game of Life, compute summary statistics from 10,000 runs, and run a t-test for whether the means of two generators' number of generations are equal.
