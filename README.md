## PSEUDO-RANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS IN THE GAME OF LIFE 

## Description
.py
Code to create 100 x 100 board and display animation of generations. Automatic program termination when a pattern starts repeating.

.ipynb
Python notebook to simulate The Game of Life, compute summary statistics from 10,000 runs, and run a t-test for whether the means of two generators' number of generations are equal. Features randomized grid dimensions, randomized cell states, the ability to set specific pseudo random number (PRN) generators, and automatic program termination when a pattern starts repeating.
